Changing Specific Parameters in the Mate

A. Modify one parameter in the Mate.
This option is the preferred one (simple) and has priority in the script. 
To modify one single parameter use the ChangeMateStatusModBus.py script with the appropriate argument.

Arguments List
Each argument triggers a specific function in the Mate:

On          # turn on  inverter's charger
Off         # turn off inverter's charger
drop        # drop AC
use         # use AC
Generator   # switch AC mode to 
Support     # switch AC mode to       
GridTied    # switch AC mode to      
UPS         # switch AC mode to       
Backup      # switch AC mode to             
MiniGrid    # switch AC mode to            
GridZero    # switch AC mode to      
Disabled    # switch AC mode to 
StartBulk   # force Mate to 
StopBulk    # force Mate to
StartEQ     # force Mate to
StopEQ      # force Mate to  

Syntax Example
To change the inverter AC mode to MiniGrid, use the following syntax based on your operating system:

- Linux:
lxterminal -e python3 /var/www/html/mate3_homeassistant/ChangeMateStatusModBus.py MiniGrid

- Windows:
python3 //192.168.0.100/web/mate3_homeassistant/ChangeMateStatusModBus.py MiniGrid

Execute the script as 

B. To modify multiple parameters at once in the Mate. 
This option is used when multiple parameters needs to be modified in the same script run. The option is more complex and usually to integrate various scripts.PAss variables 

Steps:
1. update the mate_input.json as per your need using the accepted arguments by ChangeMateStatusModBus.py script. This can be done manually or by another script
2. run the ChangeMateStatusModBus.py script without any argument. 

How is working:
During start_up, the script will open mate_input.json. When changes are detected (different than "notset") in mate_input.json those parameters will be modified in that run. 
Date taken will be updated and those specific parameters will be set in "notset" in mate_input.json.
If argument is provided this is the priority.

Simple home assistant automation can be done using both options. 

General note: 
Please be carefully with Mate update. 
Despite the fact that script has protections to do mistakes (i.e wrong parameters outside of provided list) use this as on your own risk.
